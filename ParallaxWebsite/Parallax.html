               Angkor Wat is an enormous Buddhist temple complex located in northern Cambodia.
               It was originally built in the first half of the 12th century as a Hindu temple.
               Spread across more than 400 acres, Angkor Wat is said to be the largest religious
               monument in the world. Its name, which translates to “temple city” in the Khmer
               language of the region, references the fact it was built by Emperor <b>Suryavarman II</b>,
               who ruled the region from 1113 to 1150, as the state temple and political center of his empire.

                The Konark or Konarak Sun temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya, and, conceived as a giant stone chariot with 12 wheels,
                it is the most famous of the few sun temples built in India. It is located about 35 km northeast of the city of Puri on the coastline
                in the state of Odisha (earlier Orissa). It was built c. 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I (r. 1238-1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty
                (8th century CE - 15th century CE).
